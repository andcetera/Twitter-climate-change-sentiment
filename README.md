# Twitter Climate Change Sentiment

The purpose of our project was to analyze climate change sentiment through Twitter user post data, primarily focusing on US-based users and users who deny the existence of climate change, to see what patterns we could find.

---  

## Our Initial Research Questions:  

1. What trends, if any, are present in climate related tweets? Has the stance, sentiment, or aggression of Tweets changed significantly in the 2010s?  

2. What trends might we uncover by isolating the tweets denying climate change?  Are there any patterns to find that would help make sense of the spread of misinformation on social media?  

3. What does Twitter activity look like before and after a major natural disaster?

## Project Structure

You can find the main scripts for this project in the Individual_Contributors folder.  Each question was approached by a different team member as listed below:  

>Question 1 - [Jennifer Shulyak](https://github.com/JenniferM-BShulyak)  
>Question 2 - [Becky Klosowski](https://github.com/andcetera)  
>Question 3 - [Joe Moreno](https://github.com/jrm33)  

Raw data resources and original data splices can be found in the Resources folder, including .py files used to cut the original dataframe down to usable pieces.  These won't function since they are referencing the original 2GB file not included on GitHub due to filesize constraints but are only included for context only.

Images of data visualization can be found in the Images folder.  You can also find a completed copy of the presentation slides at the root level of the repo.

## Our Original Datasets:

### [Climate Change Twitter Data Set & Disasters Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deffro/the-climate-change-twitter-dataset)

>"Abstract: This work creates and makes publicly available the most comprehensive dataset to date regarding climate change and human opinions via Twitter. It has the heftiest temporal coverage, spanning over 13 years, includes over 15 million tweets spatially distributed across the world, and provides the geolocation of most tweets. Seven dimensions of information are tied to each tweet, namely geolocation, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, and topic modeling, while accompanied by environmental disaster events information. These dimensions were produced by testing and evaluating a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and methods, both supervised and unsupervised, including BERT, RNN, LSTM, CNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, VADER, Textblob, Flair, and LDA."
