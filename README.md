# Twitter Climate Change Sentiment

Analyzing climate change sentiment through Twitter user post data, primarily focusing on US-based users and users who deny the existence of climate change

---  

## Our Initial Research Questions:  

1. What trends, if any, are present in climate related tweets? Has the stance, sentiment, or aggression of Tweets changed significantly in the 2010s?  

2. What trends might we uncover by isolating the tweets denying climate change?  Are there any patterns to find that would help make sense of the spread of misinformation on social media?  

3. What does Twitter activity look like before and after a major natural disaster?

## Our Original Datasets:

### [Climate Change Twitter Data Set & Disasters Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deffro/the-climate-change-twitter-dataset)

>"Abstract: This work creates and makes publicly available the most comprehensive dataset to date regarding climate change and human opinions via Twitter. It has the heftiest temporal coverage, spanning over 13 years, includes over 15 million tweets spatially distributed across the world, and provides the geolocation of most tweets. Seven dimensions of information are tied to each tweet, namely geolocation, user gender, climate change stance and sentiment, aggressiveness, deviations from historic temperature, and topic modeling, while accompanied by environmental disaster events information. These dimensions were produced by testing and evaluating a plethora of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and methods, both supervised and unsupervised, including BERT, RNN, LSTM, CNN, SVM, Naive Bayes, VADER, Textblob, Flair, and LDA."

# Original Assignment Details:

## Project Guidelines
The following project guidelines focus on teamwork, your project proposal, data sources, and data cleanup and analysis.

## Collaborating with Your Team
Remember that these projects are a group effort. The experience of close collaboration will create better project outcomes and help you in your future careers. Specifically, you’ll learn collaborative workflows that will enable you to approach and solve complex problems. Working in groups allows you to work smart and dream big. Take advantage!

## Project Proposal
Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project. This will help provide direction and safeguard against scope creep (the tendency for projects to become more complex after work begins).

The proposal is essentially a brief summary of your interests and intent. Be sure to include the following details:

- The kind of data you’d like to work with and the field you’re interested in (finance, healthcare surveys, etc.)

- The questions you’ll ask of the data

- Possible source for the data

Use the following example for guidance:

The aim of our project is to uncover patterns in credit card fraud. We’ll examine relationships between transaction types and location, purchase prices and times of day, purchase trends over the course of a year, and other related relationships derived from the data.

## Finding Data
Once your group has written a proposal, it’s time to start searching for data. We recommend the following curated sources of high-quality data:

- data.world

- Kaggle

- Data.gov

- Awesome Public Datasets

- Public-APIs

- Awesome API

- Medium API

>  **IMPORTANT**
>Whenever you use a dataset or create a new dataset based on other sources (such as existing datasets or information scraped from websites), make sure to use the following guidelines:
>
>1. Check for copyright protections, and make sure that the way  >you plan to use this dataset is within the bounds of fair use.
>
>2. Document how you intend to use this dataset now and in the future. Find any licenses or terms of use associated with the dataset, and review them to confirm that your intended use is in compliance.
>
>3. Investigate how the dataset was collected. Identify any indicators that the data was obtained from a source that the compilers were not authorized to access.

You’ll likely have to adjust your project plan as you explore the available data. That’s okay! This is all part of the process. Just make sure that everyone in the group is aligned on the project’s goals as you make changes.

Make sure that your datasets are not too large for your personal computer. Big datasets are difficult to manage locally, so consider using data subsets or different datasets altogether.

## Data Cleanup and Analysis
Now that you’ve picked your data, it’s time to tackle development and analysis. This is where the fun starts!

The analysis process can be broken into two broad phases: (1) exploration and cleanup, and (2) analysis.

As you’ve learned, you’ll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin answering your research questions. We recommend keeping track of these exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter notebook to keep you organized and make it easier to present your work later.

After you’ve cleaned your data and are ready to start crunching numbers, you should track your work in a Jupyter notebook dedicated specifically to analysis. We recommend focusing your analysis on multiple techniques, such as aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time-series analysis. Don’t forget to include plots during both the exploration and analysis phases. Creating plots along the way can reveal insights and interesting trends in the data that you might not notice if you wait until you’re preparing for your presentation. Presentation requirements will be further explained in the next module.

## Presentation Day
It’s crucial that you find time to rehearse before presentation day.

On the day of your presentation, each member of your group is required to submit the URL of your GitHub repository for grading.

- Each question in the project proposal is answered with precise descriptions and findings (5 points)
- Findings are strongly supported with numbers and visualizations (5 points)
- Each question response is supported with a well-discerned statistical analysis from lessons (e.g., aggregation, correlation, comparison, summary statistics, sentiment analysis, and time series analysis) (5 points)
### Group Presentation (20 points)
- All group members spoke during the presentation (5 points)
- Group was well prepared (5 points)

This project will be evaluated against the requirements and assigned a grade according to the following table:

|Grade|Points|
|-----|------|
|A (+/-)|90+|
|B (+/-)|80–89|
|C (+/-)|70–79|
|D (+/-)|60–69|
|F (+/-)|< 60|

>  **NOTE**
>Projects are requirements for graduation. While you are allowed to miss up to two Challenge assignments and still earn your certificate, projects cannot be skipped.
